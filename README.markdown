Data Visualisation with Ruby
==========

Code
----------

There are many different ways of visualising data if you are a Ruby
user. Included in this repository are code samples for the following
libraries:

* R
* Gnuplot
* Google Charts API
* JFreeChart 
* Scruffy
* Timetric
* Tioga

These examples were used in a presentation I gave at the [Ruby Manor
conference](http://http://rubymanor.org/) in London in December
2009. The slides from that presentation are in this repository
(slides.pdf), and a link to the video will be included when it is
released.

What about Javascript?
----------------------

If you're in the market for a charting/plotting library to use on your
rails website, you may prefer a javascript library instead of a
ruby-based server-side solution. Roberto Bicchierai has [written up a
good
comparison](http://roberto.open-lab.com/2009/12/21/javascript-charting-tools-an-overview/)
of the available libraries. 

Contributing

If you have examples of data visualisation using these libraries, or
indeed other libraries which I haven't covered, feel free to fork this
project and add some samples.
